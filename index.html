    <p>Computer Science is the study of the theoretical foundations
       of information and computation and of practical techniques
       for their implementation and application in computer systems.
       It is frequently described as the systematic study of algorithmic
        processes that describe and transform information; the fundamental
        question under lying Computer Science is, “What can be (efficiently)
        automated?” Programming language studies approaches to describing
        computations, while computer programming applies specific
        programming languages to solve specific computational problems,
        and human-computer interaction focuses on the challenges in making
        computers and computations useful, usable, and universally accessible
        to people.The general public sometimes confuses Computer Science with
        vocational areas that deal with computers (such as information technology),
        or think that it relates to their own experience of computers, which
        typically involves activities such as gaming, web-browsing, and
        web-processing. However, the focus of Computer Science is more on
        understanding the properties of the programs used to implement software
        such as games and web-browsers, and using that understanding to create
        new programs or improve existing ones. Computer Science is designed
        to test students programming abilities. It is not the same as the
        computer application contest, which tests students abilities to user
        word processing, spreadsheet,and database application software,
        including integration of applications.The Diploma in Computer Science
        and Engineering prepares you for a challenging and dynamic career
        in the IT world. You will be equipped with the necessary skills
        to specify, design, test, implement and maintain effective computer-based
        application. Students of Computer Science and Engineering course 
        will gain specialized knowledge and practical skills inboth software
        and hardware aspects of computer.  Computer Science department is most
        sought after department of our college, which has emerged into a very 
        sophisticated section in a very small period of time. The major attraction 
        of the department is its well equipped computer labs consisting of latest u
        Pentium IV machines and facilities provided for the students in library 
        in the form of books to utilize and at the same time gain knowledge. 
        The emphasis is on maximum “hands-on training”, with high end machines. 
        Our students are working in various software industries all over 
        the world.</p><br><br>
